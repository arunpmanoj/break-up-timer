Project Description

An interactive web application that predicts the lifespan of a relationship by analyzing the user's Spotify playlist.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)

In the modern age of swiping right and ghosting, who has time to wonder how long a relationship will actually last? The anxiety of the unknown is a burden on us all. We've taken on the challenge of solving this pressing issue.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Our solution is a timer that calculates the "Break-Up Timer" based on the songs in your Spotify playlist. This countdown helps you monitor your relationship's progress and prepares you for the moment the timer hits zero. It's the most honest tool you'll ever use.
