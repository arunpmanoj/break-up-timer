Project Description

An interactive web application that predicts the lifespan of a relationship by analyzing the user's Spotify playlist.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)

In the modern age of swiping right and ghosting, who has time to wonder how long a relationship will actually last? The anxiety of the unknown is a burden on us all. We've taken on the challenge of solving this pressing issue.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Our solution is a timer that calculates the "Break-Up Timer" based on the songs in your Spotify playlist. This countdown helps you monitor your relationship's progress and prepares you for the moment the timer hits zero. It's the most honest tool you'll ever use.

The workflow for the relationship lifespan prediction app using a Spotify playlist consists of several key stages:
The user accesses the interactive web application through a React-based frontend.
The app prompts the user to log in via their Spotify account, authorizing access to their playlists using the Spotify API.
The backend receives the playlist data and analyzes song features, genres, sentiment, and listening habits.
Predictive algorithms process this information to estimate the potential lifespan of the user's relationship.
The result is sent back and visualized on the frontend, allowing users to interact with predictions and insights based on their music preferences.
